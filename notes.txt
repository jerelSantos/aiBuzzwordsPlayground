buzzwords: 
    inference optimization
    RAG

RAG implementation:
    pre. get podcast scripts and put it into vectorDB. Do this via:
        a. script to automatically scrape websites html for relevant podcast scripts
        b. manually
    1. search vectorDB for relevant info
    2. use agent to verify if information from vectorDB actually matches

    WHAT IF:
        *(RAG implementation) I train an agent on random chunks from a variety of podcasts.
        This agent will be used to look through transcripts of dialogue in podcasts.
        The agent will identify "good" sections of conversation and then will store it into the vectorDB.
        This automates training data that our RAG podcast bot can use to generate good podcast scripts.
