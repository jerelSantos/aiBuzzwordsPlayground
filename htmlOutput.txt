There were so many doubters, so many naysayers. So many people didn't want you to get that title shot. It was so unfair, dude. It was really wild. It was wild to see. It really was. It really was. Because I'm like, are you guys not watching his fights? Like, what the fuck are you guys seeing? I. I do not understand when people don't appreciate excellence. I really don't get it. I never like the Sean Brady fight. You see that fight? You don't think this dude is a fucking problem for everybody?

Like with Deshaun Brady, all I did was stand up. I didn't shoot one takedown on him. Gilbert Burns, I didn't shoot one takedown wonder boy, I took him down. Obviously, I'm not going to strike with a kickboxer. So I've showed you guys all forms of martial arts, and people still hate it. They're like, they're still hating.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 73 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:01:13]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> So crazy.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 75 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:01:15]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> Even with the Leon fight, so even.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 76 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:01:16]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> For this fight, I think they have to shut the fuck up. I think everybody has to shut the fuck up and just recognize what you did because you put so much pressure on him standing up. You were in his face from the very 1st second of the very first round. You just advanced and you could tell he wanted that space and you could tell it was a different experience than what he thought he was going to get from you.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 99 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:01:39]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> Yeah, I mean, when we saw him against Kobe and him against Usman, the third fight, we saw that he's expert at distance, he manages the distance. He puts it at his own pace. So we were like, bro, we got to make this dirtiest fight, the hardest fight for him. So we got to step right away. So even when the ref was, like, looking to me, tell me to back up, when he looked at Leon and said, you ready? You ready? I'm walking forward right away, so I'm right in his face before he even like, looks up. So I was like, I gotta get him on his back foot right away, make him uncomfortable. And I knew he's not good, uncomfortable. None of these. No striker is really good moving backwards. But I knew Leon specifically. I don't want to be in his kick range. I don't want him at his slow pace like he did against Kobe and these guys where he kicks, moves, kicks, moves. I'm like, I'm going to be in his face nonstop, punching him in his mouth and taking him down whenever I see an opening.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 146 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:02:26]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> The Colby fight, I thought was going to be different. I think Colby broke his foot real early in that fight.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 153 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:02:33]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> I mean, I think Kobe sucks, but for me, I think that Kobe wasn't. He's just not a good striker. Even with the fights that we see that he was really good at, it was just. Cause he could have. He put a good pace on all these guys and he dictated the pace with RDa and I, Robbie Lawler, all these guys, but none of those guys really had that type of cardio. When we saw him against Usman, Usman showed you, all right? He could keep up that pace with Kobe, and then Kobe can't take him down. So it ended up being like a kickboxing match for Leon. He knew if he dictated the pace with Kobe, Kobe wasn't going to be able to do anything to him. And I don't think the time off, I think, hurt Kobe's distance management because his shot takedowns were terrible in that fight. He didn't. He wasn't managing it.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 195 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:03:15]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> I think the foot had a big factor because I think he broke his foot. I think Leon checked the kick real early on, or he kicked low and hit the shin and broke his foot, hit the knee, something. I don't remember exactly what happened, but apparently in the first round he broke his foot. If you can't move against Leon, you're in real trouble.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 213 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:03:33]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> Yeah. I mean, especially cause Leon's so good at his lateral movement and his kicks hurt so hard.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 218 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:03:38]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 219 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:03:39]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> So for me, I was like, I can't be in kicking range at all. I think I felt like one. One body kick early, and I was like, all right, let me step forward on it. So even with my mindset the whole camp, I probably took two to 3000 body kicks and then moved forward on each of them. And if I backed up at all, my coach is yelling at me, look what you did here. You did this wrong. Move forward. Move forward. We can't take one step back. So I was like, I was writing it down, I was putting it in my head. Do not take a step back. Do not take a step back. And then it just came out in the fight.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 247 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:04:07]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> It came out perfect. It was a master plan. It really was. Watching you execute it, I was just so. I was so shocked. First of all, inability to deal with you on the feet, because even if it was just a kickboxing match, there was so much pressure and so much volume of strikes. You were constantly on him. Your boxing was so on point, man. It would look better than it's ever looked.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 270 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:04:30]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> Yeah. I think people just underestimate me when they look at me, because they say, oh, he doesn't have a bunch of knockouts. But when you look at my fights and you see the way I pieced up a lot of these big names like Gilbert and Sean Brady, I beat them both on the feet. And for the Leon fight, my gym is small, but we have. I work with, I think, who's the best striker in the UFC right now. He's a 55 er, Ignacio Balaamundez. Like, this kid is a monster. He probably has, like, monster. You saw. Yeah. His spinning hill kick knockout.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 297 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:04:57]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> I'm dangerous.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 297 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:04:57]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> I'm sparring with this dude every single day. So I'm like, nothing that Leon was gonna throw at me was gonna surprise me. Nothing was gonna make me uncomfortable. And for me, if you're beating me up, I want to keep going to you. So for nacho, I'm like, bro, throw the kitchen sink at me. I want you to throw everything you have in your tool bag at me. So if whatever Leon throws, I'm just going to be comfortable in that fire. So for me, it was just nonstop, non stop sparring, sparring, sparring, even if it's not hard sparring, light sparring, just enough to see everything and have my reaction time. And I think that helps a lot with the way I've been fighting lately.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 331 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:05:31]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> How much time did you have to prepare for Leonida?</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 334 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:05:34]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> I had about eight weeks.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 335 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:05:35]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> Did they. Did you kind of have an inkling that it was going to happen before that?

And then you're like, when is it happening? They're like, well, Kobe has to fight first. So then I'm sitting there in the, playing the waiting game, and then they offered me Usman. They're like, well, you know, if you don't want to wait, we could give you Usmanda. So we had talks with Usman, and then Usman ended up fighting Hamza on short notice. So then I was like, all right, well, there's nothing else they could put in front of me. It's gonna be me against the winner of Kobe and Leon. Then that fight happens, and then Leon's trying to brush it off, like, nah, there's still other guys I could look at and see who's next. And he even brought up Gilbert burns. And I'm like, bro, I just beat Gilbert burns. So I'm sitting there, you know, in limbo, like, what's happening? I'm calling my manager every day, and Ali's my manager, and he's like, bro, trust me, Dana's not gonna go against his word. He's gonna give you the shot. He's gonna give you the shot.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 388 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:06:28]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> Then all of a sudden, a 300 comes up, and I'm like, oh, so we're probably gonna be 300? And then they say, oh, they offered to fight to three other guys, and I was one of those guys. So then, like, I'm sitting there like, bro, wait, no way am I about to get screwed right now. Are they gonna give it to somebody else?</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 403 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:06:43]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> Did you ask, like, why didn't I get the fight at 300? If they were trying to get Leon to fight at 300, why didn't you get that title shot?</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 411 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:06:51]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> For me, it was just. I put it out there. I said, if they really wanted Leon to fight there, they would have put me on there because I said yes. You know, they asked. They said, they asked Islam, they said. They asked Shavka, they said, they asked Hamza, and they all said no because of Ramadan. But I fought multiple times during Ramadan. So for me, I'm like, if they really wanted Leon, they could have had him with me. But I think they just wanted to have that shock factor with 300 where it's like, oh, double champ status for Islam or Hamza, obviously a huge star, he comes back down. So I think they just wanted that. And Lee has not a promoter. He doesn't really promote his fights in general. Obviously, he's a great fighter, but for 300, I think they want somebody that's going to try to push the event.</p></div><div class="hsp-paragraph" title="Paragraph From 450 seconds"><span class="hs-font-positive small-base hsp-paragraph-timestamp" title="Timestamp">[00:07:30]</span><p class="hs-font-positive base hsp-paragraph-words"> Yeah, but still, yeah, the rules are the rules.

The reality of the numbers is I had a joke in my act that 1090 percent of all twitter is done by 10% of the people, and those people are 100% retarded. But it really almost is that. I mean, it's a joke, but it's kind of almost true because are you commenting on shit all the time? Do you go to someone's YouTube videos and talk shit? You're busy. You're busy being the fucking welterweight champion of the world. You ain't got no time for that. So the people that have time to be doing that all the time are unfortunately, generally not doing that good. They're not. Michael Jordan's not leaving YouTube comments. You know what I'm saying? It's like the people that are engaged in these attacks on specific fighters in particular, they're usually just dorks. And I get it that these dorks by pay per view, and I get it, these dorks. But they're not most people. Most people want to see the best people fight the best people. And would it be exciting to see Islam go up and try to win at 170?

We watch football games at noon. We wouldn't watch world title fights at noon. Making you guys fight at five in the morning, to me, was bananas.

So the hardest part was just trying to stay up from midnight to 04:00 a.m. to go drive to this gym. And, you know, we had, like, a big house, so we had a bunch of people with us, but one person yawns, and it's, like, addictive. And it's like, bro, it's midnight.

Damian sneaks that leg in, and now Kamaru starts to get in trouble. Cause Damian takes that left arm. He goes all the way over and cinches the waist. So now he's. He's pretty deep. Kamaro's the thing that's saving Camaro here is his right arm. That whizzer on his right arm is the thing that's saving him. But he's in danger now. He's in much more danger, because now Damian has the hook, and now Damian's pulling that arm over the top of Kamaru's whizzer. So he'll connect his arms if the referee lets him. What he wants to do is connect his hands in front of Kamaru. Kamaru does not want that. They're hand fighting right here. But this is a dangerous spot for Kamaru.

And that's what he wants to do here. So he wants to put all this pressure on, make Camaro do something to defend all the leverage he's putting on his legs, defend these punches. He's setting up little traps, just trying to open up the space so that he could get that right hook in and that left arm over the top. So he is on the back now, like, fully on the back.

See if you can find. What does it say? 86. Okay, so that was right before he won the title. He won the title when he was 20. So I was like, just out of high school and he was the guy, like, heavyweight boxing had gotten boring. Nobody cared. After Larry Holmes was like, people were bored with heavyweight boxing. There was a bunch of champions and nobody heard of. It was like they weren't really interested. No disrespect to any of those guys, but they didn't excite the public the way Muhammad Ali did, the way George Foreman did. It wasn't heavyweight. Boxing was kind of dead.

Terrible, bad situation, horrible poverty and crime. And then all of a sudden he's being taken care of by this dude who's a master boxer, master boxing coach, trained world champions like Jose Torres and Floyd Patterson.

He was learning how to put himself into a mindset of just an unstoppable juggernaut that had one goal, one task, and Cuss would tell him, you don't exist, only the task exists. Like, you don't exist.

All you're getting better has already been done. And in the six weeks or eight weeks, whatever your camp is, you should be only concentrating on cardio, and they would do these explosive plyometric things. BJ hated it. He hated it. But if you look at his gas tank from those fights, it was unstoppable. And when a fighter is not tired and the other fighter is tired, and you realize all that work is paid off, and you start putting it on him, and you got this unlimited gas tank, and you also haven't been beat up in training for six to eight weeks because you really not sparring, you're really not doing much of anything other than your cardio. They're just doing plyometrics. It's all just jumping around and shit. It's all you ever seen.

He was telling me that it's really at an elite fighter that's fighting a world championship fight, they already know how to fight. You just got to give them the unstoppable gas tank. And if you concentrate only on that, it's the most important thing, because when a fighter gets tired, like, when Izzy got tired in that fourth round with Trickus, you could see he's not the same Izzy in the first round. That's like lightning fast and moving and countering and controlling distance and getting out of the range of shots. This is an Izzy that's experiencing fatigue. Yeah, but he already knows how to fight. Like, the fighting is in his DNA at this point. He knows how to fuck people up. And if he had, like, here's. Here's BJ training with the Marinovitches. So it's all these plyometrics. Even with the arms, it's all this explosive shit. Everything is done for time and distance, and they measure everything.

So I think mentally just puts me in a different place. But for fight camps, like, after it's time to break my fast, when it's sun and sunsets, that's when I have to be the smartest.
